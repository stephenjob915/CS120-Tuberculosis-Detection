To run:

1. Download cmake, make, and opencv (brew install cmake, brew install make, brew install opencv)
2. cd build
3. bash build.bash
4. Put some images in build/test/
5. Run ./image_processor

Open your x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS and paste these two blocks.

Step One: Build
This ensures the computer is still looking at the right OpenCV folders and recompiles your main.cpp to make sure the accuracy logic is active.

cd "C:\Users\steph\OneDrive\Documents\CS120 Tuberculosis Detector\CS120-Project-main\build"
set OpenCV_DIR="C:\Users\steph\OneDrive\Documents\CS120 Tuberculosis Detector\opencv\build\x64\vc16\lib"
cmake --build . --config Release

Step Two: Train & Detect
This moves into your app folder, runs the trainer to refresh your weights.txt, and then runs the detector to give you the final Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

cd Release
trainer.exe
image_processor.exe
